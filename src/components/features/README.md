# Features Components

This directory contains feature-specific components that are used across the application.

## Purpose

Feature components are reusable components that implement specific business logic or domain features. They typically compose multiple UI components together.

## Examples

- Product listings
- Shopping cart
- User profile components
- Authentication forms
- Search functionality

## Guidelines

- Components should be self-contained and reusable
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Use UI components from `@/components/ui`
- Keep business logic in separate hooks or utilities
